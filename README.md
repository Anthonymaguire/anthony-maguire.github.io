### Senior Petroleum Engineer | Subsurface Specialist

Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a licensed Petroleum Engineer dedicated to maximizing asset value through a combination of traditional reservoir engineering and modern data analytics.

## 🎯 Professional Focus
* **Reservoir Management:** Simulation (Eclipse/Petrel), History Matching, and Forecasting.
* **Production Optimization:** Nodal analysis, Artificial Lift design (ESP/Gas Lift), and Bottleneck identification.
* **Digital Oilfield:** Developing Python-based tools for real-time well surveillance and predictive maintenance.
* **Energy Transition:** Evaluating Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) feasibility in depleted reservoirs.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
| Category | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simulation** | Eclipse 100/300, Petrel, CMG (IMEX/GEM/STARS), tNavigator |
| **Production** | Petroleum Experts (Prosper, Gap, MBAL), Pipesim, OLGA |
| **Data Science** | Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL, PowerBI, Spotfire |
| **Economics** | PEEP, Val Nav, Aries |

## 📂 Key Projects
* **North Sea Brownfield Recovery:** Optimized waterflood patterns using 4D seismic integration, resulting in a 15% reduction in Opex.
* **Permian Basin Automation:** Built an automated Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) tool in Python, reducing engineering man-hours by 40%.
